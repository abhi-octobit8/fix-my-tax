                  If you get an income tax notice, you should understand why the
                  notice has been sent. Notices may be sent due to various
                  reasons. For example, Notices may be sent for the details and
                  papers required by the Income Tax Department. In such a case,
                  you need to provide the details as required. If there is any
                  error in the ITR, then notices may be sent to rectify the
                  error. In such a case, you should then rectify any error in
                  your return and respond to the notice with the time specified
                  by the income tax department to avoid possible penalties.

                  If you dont respond to the income tax notice, there can be

                  Notice which you would have to face. Such consequences include
                  fines of up to INR 10,000 and also imprisonment for up to a
                  year.
