                  <p>
                    If you get an income tax notice, you should understand why
                    the notice has been sent. Notices may be sent due to various
                    reasons. For example, Notices may be sent for the details
                    and papers required by the Income Tax Department. In such a
                    case, you need to provide the details as required. If there
                    is any error in the ITR, then notices may be sent to rectify
                    the error. In such a case, you should then rectify any error
                    in your return and respond to the notice with the time
                    specified by the income tax department to avoid possible
                    penalties.

                    If you dont respond to the income tax notice, there can be
                    different types of consequences depending upon the type of
                    Notice which you would have to face. Such consequences
                    include fines of up to INR 10,000 and also imprisonment for
                    up to a year.

                    In case you dont respond to notice within 30 days the income
