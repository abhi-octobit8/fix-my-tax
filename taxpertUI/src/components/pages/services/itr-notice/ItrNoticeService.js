              Income Tax Notices in India
            </div>
            An income tax notice is a written communication sent by the Income
            Tax Department to a taxpayer alerting an issue with his tax account.
            The notice can be sent for different reasons like filing/ non-filing
            his/ her income tax return, for the purpose of making the assessment
            or to ask the certain details etc. When a notice is sent by the
            Income Tax Department, the taxpayer has to act on the notice and get
            the matter resolved with the tax authorities.

            If the AO believes that a defective income tax return is filed, he
            would serve you notice under this section. The error can be missing
            information, use of the wrong ITR form, incomplete return, etc. The
            officer would also highlight the defect in the income tax return and
            recommend the solution thereof. You get a period of 15 days to
            respond to the notice. If you do not respond, your ITR would be
            rejected.

            filed. If you do not respond to the notice served under Section
            142(1), you would face a penalty of INR 10,000, prosecution for up

            income or not filed when he was mandated by the law. The time limit
            to send the notice under this section depends on the amount and
