                Income Tax Notices in India
              </div>
              An income tax notice is a written communication sent by the Income
              Tax Department to a taxpayer alerting an issue with his tax
              account. The notice can be sent for different reasons like filing/
              non-filing his/ her income tax return, for the purpose of making
              the assessment or to ask the certain details etc. When a notice is
              sent by the Income Tax Department, the taxpayer has to act on the
              notice and get the matter resolved with the tax authorities.
